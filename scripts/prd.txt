# Overview
Quizzer is a Chrome extension that generates contextual quizzes based on article content that users are reading. It leverages Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet LLM to create questions that encourage critical thinking and deeper engagement with digital content. Users can respond to questions via voice or text input, receiving immediate feedback on their understanding. This tool aims to enhance reading comprehension, retention, and critical analysis skills for students, professionals, and lifelong learners.

   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, optimize prompts for token efficiency, add request queuing

3. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: Poor transcription quality in noisy environments or with accents
   - **Mitigation**: Clear recording instructions, text verification before submission, text input fallback

## MVP Scope
1. **Feature Creep**
   - **Risk**: Expanding scope beyond core functionality, delaying MVP
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization matrix, regular scope reviews, clear definition of MVP success criteria

2. **User Adoption Barriers**
