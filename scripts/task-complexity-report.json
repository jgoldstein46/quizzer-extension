      "taskTitle": "Setup Chrome Extension Foundation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Chrome extension foundation setup into specific implementation steps, including manifest.json configuration, directory structure setup, React sidebar implementation, webpack configuration, and developer mode testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components (manifest.json, background scripts, React setup, webpack configuration) that require specific expertise in Chrome extension architecture. While not extremely complex, it establishes the foundation for all subsequent tasks and requires careful planning."

    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Content Extraction Module",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the content extraction module implementation into specific subtasks covering DOM traversal techniques, filtering algorithms, integration with Readability.js, metadata extraction, content structure design, and testing across various article formats.",
      "reasoning": "Content extraction involves complex DOM manipulation and heuristics to accurately identify main content while filtering irrelevant elements. This requires sophisticated algorithms to handle diverse webpage structures and edge cases, making it moderately complex."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up Anthropic Claude API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Claude API integration into subtasks covering secure API key management, request/response handling architecture, prompt construction utilities, response parsing functions, and token usage tracking implementation.",
      "reasoning": "API integration is a standard development task, but the security requirements and token management add complexity. The task requires careful implementation of authentication, error handling, and response parsing, but follows established patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Quiz Generation Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the quiz generation functionality into subtasks covering prompt template design, content preprocessing algorithms, Claude API integration for question generation, response parsing and structuring, quiz format definition, and local storage implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex prompt engineering to generate high-quality questions, sophisticated content preprocessing, and integration with the Claude API. The need to ensure questions are contextually relevant and test comprehension adds significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Build Text-Based User Input System",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the text input system into subtasks covering React component development for question display, form validation implementation, question navigation flow design, and submission handler creation with appropriate loading states.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a frontend development task with standard form handling and validation. While it requires careful UI design and state management, it follows established patterns for form implementation and doesn't involve complex algorithms."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Response Evaluation System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the response evaluation system into subtasks covering evaluation prompt design, scoring mechanism implementation, feedback formatting, result storage architecture, follow-up prompt generation, edge case handling, and testing with diverse response types.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it requires sophisticated prompt engineering to accurately evaluate free-text responses, implement nuanced scoring algorithms, and generate helpful feedback. The AI evaluation component introduces significant complexity and potential for edge cases."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Quiz Results and Summary UI",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the quiz results UI development into subtasks covering overall performance display design, detailed feedback view implementation, question review navigation, session management options, and responsive design within sidebar constraints.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard UI development with some data visualization components. The complexity comes from designing an intuitive interface to display complex feedback data within the constraints of a sidebar, but follows established UI patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Voice Input Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the voice input functionality into subtasks covering Web Speech API integration, microphone UI component development, real-time transcription display, confidence scoring implementation, verification interface design, and fallback mechanism implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Voice recognition involves complex browser API integration, handling permissions, and managing the unreliability of speech recognition. The real-time aspects and need for fallback mechanisms add significant complexity to this feature."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Local Storage and Session Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the storage and session management implementation into subtasks covering data model design, Chrome Storage API integration, session state management, CRUD operations implementation, and data cleanup routines.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful data modeling and state management across the extension. The complexity comes from designing a robust storage architecture that handles various data types and maintains consistency across sessions."

      "taskTitle": "Finalize UI/UX and Implement Accessibility Features",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI/UX finalization into subtasks covering styling implementation, animation development, keyboard shortcut integration, screen reader compatibility, WCAG compliance verification, user preference settings, and onboarding flow creation.",
      "reasoning": "This task encompasses a wide range of UI/UX and accessibility requirements that span the entire extension. The comprehensive nature of accessibility compliance, combined with polishing the entire user experience, makes this a complex task requiring attention to numerous details."
